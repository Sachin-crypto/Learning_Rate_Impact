# Learning Rate Impact

Studying the impact of learning rate on a multi-class classification problem using Scikit Learn and Keras. Following that studied the impact of momentum on the neural networks. In the end, various optimizers are tested that use stochastic gradient descent with adaptive learning rates to find out which works well with the model.

# Grab the Dataset
Download the [BMI dataset](https://github.com/Sachin-crypto/Learning_Rate_Impact/blob/main/bmi_data.csv) from the repository.

# How to Run

Either copy the code and paste it into your newly created Colab Notebook, upload the BMI dataset into Google Drive, mount the drive, and then specify the path to the BMI dataset or click on the Colab link in the code, upload the dataset and specify the path to the dataset after mounting the drive.

# Run Locally

First, Download the BMI dataset and save it in a local drive then copy the code and paste it into your Python file created inside your favorite IDE.

# Errors you may Face
You are most likely to face import errors of Keras modules and functions from TensorFlow when you run the code from your IDE. In that case, you can resolve it by reading the documentation or you can use Python v3.9.
